          <h2 class="primary-header">ABOUT ME</h2>
          <p>
            I am currently a retail worker making the transition to a career in web development as a front end
            developer. I am mostly self taught but I have attended some college in the past, focusing on computer
            science.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blue-text">My History</h4>
          <p>
            I have had an interest in computers and programming for many years, starting with languages such as C and
            C++. I eventually began focusing on <strong>JavaScript</strong> and other web development topics such as
            <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>. In the past few years I have been mostly working with React,
            creating small hobby websites for myself.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blue-text">Favorite Project</h4>
          <p>
            My favorite project is a website I created for helping people study for the FCC's amateur radio license
            exams. The amateur radio exams consist of a set of questions selected from a question pool released by the
            FCC as PDF files and some text files. I created some node scripts to convert the PDF and text data into JSON
            data which I then uploaded to the CMS Contentful. I then created a website that pulls the data from
            Contentful and creates a practice exam that the user can complete.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blue-text">The Future</h4>
          <p>
            I am always learning new things and continue to improve myself as a web developer. I believe that my
            experience from working in retail for many years and my skills as a web developer would allow me to
            contribute to a company's goals.

            AMATEUR RADIO PRACTICE EXAMS
          </h3>
          <p>
            I created the site <a href="https://amater-radio.school" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer">amateur-radio.school</a> to
            help people study for the amateur radio licensing exams. As I mentioned in the <a href="#about-me">about
              me</a> section above, I uploaded all the questions from the question pools to <strong>Contentful</strong>.
            I then created a front end for the site using <strong>React</strong>. For the styling I used <strong>Styled
              Components</strong>. The site is hosted on <strong>Netlify</strong>.
          </p>

          </div>

          <p>
            The user can choose between three different license levels for the exam they want to practice. The exams are
            then generated and the user can work their way through the test. The user is given a score at the end and
            notified if they pass or fail. The grading and the questions chosen are based on the requirements from the
            FCC. If you are interested you can read more at <a href="http://www.arrl.org/question-pools" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer">arrl.org</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like most of my projects, this is still a work in progress. There are a couple of things I want to change.
            The most difficult part was converting the questions to JSON and getting them into a CMS, and now that that
            is done creating any kind of front end is possible.</p>
          <p>
            I am planning on redoing the site using <strong>Next.Js</strong> rather than using Create React App. Using
            <strong>Next.Js</strong> will allow me to more easily generate the exams, right now they are generated each
            time a user starts an exam which can be slow at times.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blue-text">Some Other Features I Want To Add:</h4>
          <ul class="regular-list">
            <li>Ability for users to save progress in exams.</li>
            <li>Marking questions wrong or right as the user takes the exam.</li>
            <li>A summary of the wrong answers and links to help the user study.</li>
            <li>User accounts.</li>
          </ul>

            <img src="images/screenshots/news-aggregator-screenshot.jpg" width="1000" height="845"
              alt="News Aggregator Screenshot">
          </div>

          <p>
            A project I am currently working on is a Mini News Aggregator. It uses Hygraph CMS (which used to be
            GraphCMS) to store
            all the content. You can add Tweets to the CMS, YouTube Videos, and links to other news articles and a site
            will be
            generated. You can create an entry for each day and an index will be generated that links to each entry.
          </p>

          <p>
            The site is created with <strong>NextJS</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The site is static generated and fetches the content from Hygraph using GraphQL. The Tweets were originally
            directly
            embedded using Twitter's embedding option but that turned out to be too slow and caused the page to take
            forever to
            load. To fix this I created a custom Tweet component that grabs the data directly from the Twitter API and
            wrote some css to make it look the same as a real Tweet.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blue-text">The Tweet component has several nice features:</h4>
          <ul class="regular-list">
            <li>Tweets are parsed and hashtags and mentions are correctly styled</li>
            <li>It handles Tweets with and without media</li>
            <li>Since it is built with NextJS it supports responsive images and lazy loading using NextJS' Image
              component</li>
          </ul>


          <p>
            I had a similar problem with the YouTube videos. Embedding videos causes a site to really slow down, so I
            ended up
            using a small library called <strong>lite-youtube-embed</strong>. It reduces the amount of content needed
            until the video is
            actually
            played.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can see a demo of the project hosted on <a href="https://polite-taiyaki-3dfb29.netlify.app/"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a>. The project is still a <strong>work in
              progress</strong> so it
            is
            going to continue to be updated and changed.

          <p>
            I created a simple Skeleton component for React. It can be used as a placeholder for content that is
            currently loading. I made it to be as easy as possible to use and it only requires one JavaScript file
            and one CSS file. There are no other dependencies (except React of course.)
